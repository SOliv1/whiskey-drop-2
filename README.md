     #Whiskey Drop Project
     ##Bootstrap Deprecated

This is an another example of the Whiskey Drop website - I have learned, using 
Bootstrap 3 deprecated.  

I have added my own section as part of an excercise 
at the bottom of the page using bootstrap tables and "lato" font family which I 
like - it is clean and elegant - implying a summer feeling.  It may not exactly
suit the theme of the whiskey drop project.  But I like it anyway.

Another interesting take on the collapsing navbar theme with transparant. As the
instructor mentions below:

"We've got white on a transparent background, our hover styles are looking a 
bit nicer as well from the default Bootstrap ones."

I have done a bit of exploring on the navagation menu and will probably 
come back to this at a later stage.
But for now I just wanted to get this excercise finished so that I can get on
with the next one.  

I have really enjoyed the Whiskey Drop lessons.
